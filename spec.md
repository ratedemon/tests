 # Incode Group Test Task

 # 1) Source-tree builder: (expected time to complete: 30 minutes)

 ## You have to build a script which will:
  - order folders in ASC order
  - build a source tree according to a folder's name 
  - write a new sorted source tree in a new file named 'sorted-folders.json'
 ## IMPORTANT NOTE: '/' can also be a valid name of a folder. E.G. below
 ##  'folder///another' will have such order 'folder' -> '/' -> 'another'

 ## Expected result: 
  - run `node script.js`
  - notify user that parse has started
  - notify user after parsing has ended
  - new file 'sorted-folders.json' has been created(should have valid JSON string with structured source tree)
   
 ## You may use: any helpful library on your choice; 
 

 # 2) Twitter-parser: (expected time to complete: 1 hour)

 ## Build a simple app which will parse last 10 tweets from twitter.com
 ## Store them in a database (of your choice: MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc)
 ## Render them in a simple html page
